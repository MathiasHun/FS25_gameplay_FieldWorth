## Description

This mod dynamically calculates farmland prices based on its current state. 
It considers plowing, rolling, liming, fertilization, and harvest readiness to adjust the price. 
Currently, crop type and weed levels are not factored in, but these features may be added in future updates.

### In its current form, the mod shows:
  - Base price of the field
  - Price changes due to maintenance or neglect
  - Total effect on the field's value

### Future updates may include:
  - A settings menu to adjust bonus/penalty percentages
  - Consideration of crop types and weed levels for more precise valuation

This mod enhances realism by making field management directly affect land value.
